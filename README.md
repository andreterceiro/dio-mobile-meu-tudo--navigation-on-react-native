# Introduction

when we use the following command **as example**:

```
expo init react-nav --npm
```

I created a project with the above command selecting the template "Blank (TypeScript)" in the directory tests\02.

I also created a project in tests\01 with the command that I learned before:

```
npx create-expo-app example-app -t
```

I also select a template related to Blank (TypeScript) in this case.

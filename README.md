# Introduction

when we use the following command **as example**:

```
expo init react-nav --npm
```

I created a project with the above command selecting the template "Blank (TypeScript)" in the directory tests\02.

I also created a project in tests\01 with the command that I learned before:

```
npx create-expo-app example-app -t
```

I also select a template related to Blank (TypeScript) in this case.

Teacher preferred to create the project with the template blank instead the template navigation (tabs) to create the navigation from scratch, to teach concepts.


# Exploring the app created to make studies

I will talk about the app inside the **tests\02\react-nav** directory.

Remember, I created this project with the following command:

```
expo init react-nav --npm
```


# app.json

- the **app.json** file has **as example** the comfiguration related to the app icons.

# App.tsx

Teacher said the **App.tsx** file is the place where we will put our Lego pieces.

# The use of uppercase in the first letter of the names of components

Teacher instructed us to use the first letter in upper case in components.

Also, teacher said that is a good pratice to create a screens directory and store there files related to screens as I did in a previous image.

Teacher enforced that every screen is also a component.
